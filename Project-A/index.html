                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>This alien bacteria comes from a planet far from the Earth. As bacteria, it features in vegetative propagation so it always goes alone. When scientist found it, it appears as a small red ellipse with several tentacles on it.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>This creature has a strong acceptance of different environments in general, so it can move freely in the petri dish. Also, its movement is unpredictable and unconscious, which means it will move at random speed and go in random directions after it hits on the boundary.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>This creature appears as a combination of several body parts. It has eight legs, six major legs and two smaller ones as assistance. At each end of those bigger legs, there is a small dot. These dots helps the creature to better detect the environment around the creature.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Change its color if the environment is changing.</li>
                    <li>Get bigger when it receives energy.</li>
                    <li>Explode if it's too large.</li>

                Alien Bacteria is a newly discovered form of life. The sample is so rare that for now, scientists have only captured one creature. For sake of safety and its rarity, scientists can only put it into a specially made petri dish. They found some features that are contrary to the physical rules on Earth. The biggest difference is that the creature always gives out energy but not consuming any forms of food. As time goes on, scientists found that it only receives sunlight and react by getting bigger and bigger. Through cameras, scientists found that when there’s no people around the petri dish, it will change its color to colors close to light green. But still, this creature is quite unknown to people. To what extent does this creature can split? Due to its feature in spreading energy, presidents all around the world are eager to find more creatures and make use of them to provide infinite energy.
